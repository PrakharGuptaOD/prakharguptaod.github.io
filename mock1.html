  <h2>3. MedScan AI — Smart Disease Detection using SVM & KNN</h2>
  
  <!-- MCQs (Single Correct Answer) -->
  <div class="question">Q1. Support Vectors in SVM primarily influence:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: B) The position of the decision boundary</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Support vectors determine the margin and hence the precise location of the decision boundary.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q2. If the value of K in KNN is very large (close to total data points), the model will mostly:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: B) Predict majority class always</div>
  <div class="explanation">

  <div class="question">Q8. Calculate the sum of all stationary probabilities.</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: 1</div>
  <div class="explanation">

  <div class="question">Q9. If the system stays in S3, calculate the expected number of steps before moving to any other state. (Hint: Expected steps = 1 / (1 - P(S3 -> S3)))</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: 1.25</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Given P(S3 -> S3) is 0.2, the expected number of steps is 1 / (1 - 0.2) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

  <div class="question">Q10. If eigenvalue lambda = 1 corresponds to the stationary distribution, calculate the product of the determinant of P and the sum of all eigenvalues of P.</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: 0.0324</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: The sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace (sum of the diagonal entries) of the transition matrix. With the computed determinant (approximately 0.036) and the trace (approximately 0.9), their product is 0.036 x 0.9 ≈ 0.0324.

  <h2>3. MedScan AI — Smart Disease Detection using SVM & KNN</h2>
  
  <!-- MCQs (Single Correct Answer) -->
  <div class="question">Q1. Support Vectors in SVM primarily influence:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: B) The position of the decision boundary</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Support vectors determine the margin and hence the precise location of the decision boundary.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q2. If the value of K in KNN is very large (close to total data points), the model will mostly:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: B) Predict majority class always</div>
  <div class="explanation">

  <div class="answer">Answer: 1.25</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Given P(S3 -> S3) is 0.2, the expected number of steps is 1 / (1 - 0.2) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

  <div class="question">Q10. If eigenvalue lambda = 1 corresponds to the stationary distribution, calculate the product of the determinant of P and the sum of all eigenvalues of P.</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: 0.0324</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: The sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace (sum of the diagonal entries) of the transition matrix. With the computed determinant (approximately 0.036) and the trace (approximately 0.9), their product is 0.036 x 0.9 ≈ 0.0324.

  <div class="answer">Answer: a) Faster on large data; c) Divide and Conquer strategy</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Merge Sort is significantly faster than Bubble Sort (O(n log n) vs. O(n²)) and uses a divide and conquer approach.

  <!-- Scenario-Based Questions -->
  <div class="question">Scenario 1: Library wants to sort a small list of newly arrived books (less than 20 books). Suitable Algorithm:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: Insertion Sort</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Insertion Sort is highly efficient for small datasets due to its simplicity and low overhead.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Scenario 2: Library needs to sort a very large dataset of books (more than 10,000 books) based on Book Titles. Suitable Algorithm:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: Merge Sort</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Merge Sort’s O(n log n) time complexity makes it ideal for handling large datasets efficiently.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Scenario 3: Library wants to sort books where the data is already nearly sorted. Suitable Algorithm:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: Insertion Sort</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Insertion Sort works very efficiently on nearly sorted data as it requires minimal adjustments.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Scenario 4: Library wants stable sorting where the order of equal elements should not change. Suitable Algorithm:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: Merge Sort</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm that preserves the relative order of equivalent elements.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Scenario 5: Library wants best average-case performance for sorting large books data. Suitable Algorithm:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: Quick Sort</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Quick Sort generally offers excellent average-case performance, making it suitable for large datasets when well-implemented.
