  <!-- ================================================= -->
  <h2>1. PricePredictor — Preventing Overfitting in Real Estate Price Prediction using Regularization Techniques</h2>
  
  <div class="question">Q1. What is the main objective of Regularization in ML Models?</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: b) Reduce Overfitting</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Regularization methods add penalties to the loss function in order to shrink and balance coefficient values, preventing the model from memorizing noise in the training data.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q2. Which Regularization Technique is used for Feature Selection?</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: b) Lasso</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Lasso Regression (L1 regularization) tends to force some coefficients exactly to zero, thereby performing implicit feature selection.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q3. In Ridge Regression, what happens to the feature coefficients?</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: b) They are shrunk towards zero but never become zero</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) penalizes large coefficients by shrinking them but does not eliminate any feature completely.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q4. Lasso Regression minimizes:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: c) Sum of Squared Errors + L1 Penalty</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Lasso minimizes the combination of the sum of squared errors and an L1 penalty term which encourages sparsity in the coefficients.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">Q5. Which metric is often used to tune Regularization strength (λ)?</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: c) Cross-Validation Score</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Cross-validation is typically used to determine the optimal λ (or alpha) that balances bias and variance to achieve the best generalization.
  </div>
  
  <!-- MSQs -->
  <div class="question">MSQ Q6. Overfitting in ML occurs when:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: a) Model learns noise from data; c) Model performs poorly on unseen data</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Overfitting happens when a model fits both the underlying pattern and the noise within training data, resulting in poor generalization to new data.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">MSQ Q7. Regularization helps in:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: a) Reducing variance; c) Preventing overfitting</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Regularization techniques reduce model variance, which in turn helps prevent overfitting, at the cost of a small increase in bias.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">MSQ Q8. Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso when:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: b) Features are highly correlated</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 penalties and works better than Lasso when there is high multicollinearity among features.
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">MSQ Q9. Higher values of λ in Regularization will:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: b) Shrink coefficients more; c) Lead to underfitting if too large</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: Increasing λ makes the regularization penalty stronger, which shrinks coefficients further. If λ is too high, the model may become too simple (underfitting).
  </div>
  
  <div class="question">MSQ Q10. Select Regularization Techniques used in Machine Learning:</div>
  <div class="answer">Answer: a) L1 Regularization; b) L2 Regularization</div>
  <div class="explanation">
    Explanation: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularizations are the most common types used to prevent overfitting in models.
